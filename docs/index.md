# VCHEM Insurance Simulation

U.S. Health Insurance Coverage Simulation Project

This project develops a discrete-time Markov model to examine how individuals transition among four health insurance categories—employer-sponsored, other private, public (Medicaid/SCHIP/Medicare), and uninsured—across the lifespan. Drawing on 2012–2013 and 2022–2023 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), we incorporate age-spline terms and account for the complex survey design to estimate transition intensities. The goal is to create a flexible, calibrated simulation tool that sheds light on evolving coverage patterns and informs health policy decision-making.
